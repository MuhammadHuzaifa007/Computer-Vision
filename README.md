# Computer-Vision
# Overview
This repository contains a Python script that demonstrates basic image loading and displaying functionality using the OpenCV library. The images.py script loads images from the Images folder and displays them in separate windows.

# images.py Script
The images.py script performs the following tasks:
Load an Image: The script reads an image file from the specified path.
Display the Image: It displays the loaded image in a window using OpenCV.
Error Handling: If the image cannot be loaded (e.g., if the file path is incorrect or the file does not exist), an error message is printed to the console.

# Images Folder
The Images folder contains the following images:
Babar Azam.jpeg: The first picture, which is a diet plan.
M 5.jpg: The second picture, which is of a car.
